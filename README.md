Every couple months, HackClub launches a major event. Whether it's a [zombie apocalypse themed hackathon](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/) where hackers have to make tech to survive the zombie apocalypse. Or [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/), a global hackathon where teens had to create the dumbest inventions possible. HackClub is helping teens push the boundaries of technology and re-defining what education actually is.

That's why, in the summer of 2024, 50 high school hackers embarked on a journey on rails across the Canadian continent, building projects, creating bonds and making everlasting memories. [The Boreal Express](https://boreal.hackclub.com/) was an invitation to build what they cared about and to see the real impact of their idea's while travelling through remote regions only accessibly by rail.
