[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) is trying to empower teenagers to do cool stuff and give a worldwide community of thousands that they can talk to.

Whether it's a [zombie apocalypse themed hackathon](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/) where hackers have to make tech to survive the zombie apocalypse. Or [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/), a global hackathon where teens had to create the dumbest inventions possible. Hack Club is helping teens push the boundaries of technology and re-defining what education actually means.

That's why, in the summer of 2024, 50 high school hackers embarked on a journey on rails across the Canadian continent, building projects, creating bonds and making everlasting memories. [The Boreal Express](https://boreal.hackclub.com/) was an invitation to build what they cared about and to see the real impact of their idea's while travelling through remote regions only accessibly by rail.

## Chartering a Train

In 2021, we chartered a train, [The Hacker Zephyr](https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr), across America, and hosted the world's longest hackathon on land (3,502 miles).

It was one of the coolest hackathons we had ever run, so we wanted to do it again. So in collaboration with VIA Rail, Hack Club chartered a train from Vancouver to Toronto and then on to Montreal, for a once in a lifetime oppurtunity!

We invited fifty of the most creative High School hackers who were to collaborate and build sustainable solutions to technial environmental problems, all while traveling through the breathtaking scenery of Canada!
